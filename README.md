# Brain-MRI-Using-Deep-Learning

Deep learning model for classifying brain MRI images to detect the presence of tumors. The model leverages a pre-trained ResNet-18 architecture, fine-tuned on a dataset sourced from Kaggle. 
The key steps involved in the project include data collection, preparation, model training, and evaluation.

**How to Run the Brain MRI Classification Project**
**Prerequisites**

**Anaconda:**

Download and install Anaconda from here.

Anaconda includes Jupyter Notebook, which you will use to run the code.

Steps to Run the Code

**Set Up Environment:**

Open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook.

**Prepare the Dataset:**

Download the dataset zip file from the provided source.

Extract the contents of the zip file to a desired location on your computer.

**Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

Navigate to the directory where you extracted the dataset.

Place the .ipynb notebook file in the same directory.

Open the Jupyter Notebook and locate the .ipynb file.

Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

Run each code block sequentially by selecting the cell and pressing Shift + Enter.

**Note**

Ensure all necessary libraries are installed as specified in the notebook.

Follow any additional instructions provided within the notebook cells.
